    <div class="defintionHeader">World Wide Web</div><div class="definitionCopy">The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.</div>
    <div class="defintionHeader">Worm</div><div class="definitionCopy">A worm, like a virus, is a destructive self-contained program that can replicate itself. However, unlike viruses, a worm does not need to be part of another program and can self-replicate without user intervention.  A worm can become devastating if not isolated and removed. Even if it does not cause outright damage, a worm replicating out of control can exponentially consume system resources like memory and bandwidth until a system becomes unstable and unusable.</div>

XML is a specification developed by W3C starting with the recommendation on February 1 , 1998. XML is similar to HTML, XML uses tags to markup a document, allowing the browser to interpret the tags and display them on a page. Unlike HTML, XML language is unlimited (extensible) which allows self-defining tags and can describe the content instead of only displaying a page's content. Using XML other languages such as RSS and MathML have been created, even tools like XSLT were created using XML.</div>

It is based on XML, storing and transmitting data in that format. It is used for sending and receiving instant messages, maintaining buddy lists, and broadcasting the status of one's online presence. XMPP is an open protocol standard. Anyone can operate their own XMPP service, and use it to interact with any other XMPP service. The standard is maintained by XSF, the XMPP Standards Foundation.</div>
